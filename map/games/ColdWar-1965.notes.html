            <p>The Cold War... a period of great uncertainty. The 1960s saw the Berlin Wall go up, the Cuban Missile Crisis, 
                the Sino-Soviet split, the Vietnam War, the Six Days War, the continued stand-off between the Koreas, tension between India and Pakistan, 
                the end of European Colonialism (and the collapse of many successor states), and of course, the proliferation of nuclear arms. 
                This was a tense period in our history, in which any number of small conflicts could have escalated quickly into WWIII.</p>

            <p>It is a global scenario for the Cold War in 1965. It is designed for two alliances and up to six players. China and its ally, the Sino Pact, are intended to be played by the AI.</p>

            <p>As to teams, there are three alliances: USA, USSR, and China. 
                The players for each are, USA: United States, NATO and SEATO; USSR: USSR, Warsaw Pact, Arab League; and China: China, Sino Pact. 
                The two super power alliances three players each. The United States is allied with NATO and SEATO. The Soviet Union is allied with the Warsaw Pact and the Arab League. 
                China and the Sino Pact (Asian countries which China supported or had relations) are only able to move/attack in their respective starting territories and adjacent sea zones (except SZ 105).</p>

            <p>For the neutrals, there are four groups. One is the non-aligned neutral countries, which are per traditional TripleA scenarios. 
                There are also three additional players, intended to be run by the AI but have no turn. The one difference is that they are aligned with one of the other alliances. 
                This allows the US, Soviets, and China to occupy them without a fight and even help defend them.</p>
